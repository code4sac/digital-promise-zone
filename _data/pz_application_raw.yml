  subgoal_description: "Invest in a sector approach to occupational skills training that prepares jobseekers in the Promise Zone for career pathways to middle skilled jobs that ensure self-sufficiency.  There is an 18.84% unemployment rate in the proposed Promise Zone."
  activities_interventions: "Focus resources on the identified priority clusters: Health Sciences and Life Sciences; Transportation, Production and Manufacturing; Installation, Maintenance, and Repair; Information and Communications Technology; Construction and Clean Energy Technology; Administrative and Support Services; Agriculture, Food and Hospitality. [Ongoing]\n\n_\tFoster cooperation and braid WIA funds with TANF/AB98 funding received by the County of Sacramento, Department of Human Assistance (DHA) to provide subsidized employment and On-the-Job Training opportunities to Promise Zone residents. [Ongoing]\n\n_\tOffer training-related subsidized employment opportunities to support classroom instruction and improve the marketability of graduates within the Promise Zone. [Ongoing]\n\n"
  rationale_evidence: "In a recent policy brief produced by mdrc and authored by Betsy Tessler, she cites that _Although training programs abound, many low-income individuals cannot afford them, do not complete them, or do not obtain a marketable credential.  At the same time, many employers claim that they cannot easily find people with the right occupational skills to meet their needs.  Because of this skills mismatch, some types of jobs go unfilled, even in a weak economy._  A sector approach to occupational skills ensures that the unemployed are receiving the right training and skill-building for the occupations that are in-demand.  The number of job seekers completing training programs in demand industries will double through a sector approach resulting in job placement.  Leveraging existing WIA funding along with TANF/AB98 funding from the County of Sacramento will increase the training and workforce development resources available to jobseekers within the Promise Zone."

  rationale_evidence: "The Healthy People 2020 goal is set to no more than 30.6% of the population reporting obesity by the year 2020, as compared to the national benchmark of 34%.  Data from the 2009 CHIS study reveal that 61.3% of respondents from Sacramento County reported being obese, compared to the state reported rate of 59.4%.  More than 65% of respondents living at 0-200% of the federal poverty limit report being obese.  A growing body of research shows that the inclusion of safe and accessible parks and green space, whether used alone or as part of a multi-component community intervention, increase community engagement in regular physical activity. Since availability to open space is disproportionately lower in the Promise Zone, and safety issues in these neighborhoods may restrict access to physical activity, it is believed that pursuing shared use of indoor/outdoor recreational facilities for use during school or non-school hours would increase access to open space and physical activity."

Additionally, the number of children who are Dual Language Learners (DLLs) is increasing.  The number of DLLs in grades 1-8 makes up 19% of the total student population for those same grades.  Recent research also reveals that only 14% of Black and 18% of Latino males are proficient in reading by fourth grade (NAEP, 2013).   According to the article _Lessons Learned: A Review of Early Childhood Development Studies_ written by Burr and Grunewald in 2006, Economist James Heckman has determined that early investment in a child produces a rate of return of 7% to 20% in the form of higher earnings and tax payments by children and parents, reduced use of welfare, and the creation of a larger more qualified workforce."

Furthermore, the disparities in employment, health, economic opportunities and educational funding further negatively impact the performance of students in critical ways.  In order to address these disparities, we are proposing a developed and coordinated systemic effort across the various sectors of the educational pipeline to reverse the current trends.  According to the Level Playing Field Institute, to accomplish this we must acknowledge the importance of tapping an underutilized pool of potential talent for both economic growth in the state and the country and develop initiatives that will enable all of our students to reach their full potential."

Through intentional design, pathways incorporate engagement into a rational, research-based experience for every student.  In this way, effective pathways can guide students to completion _ and to success._  The Sacramento Pathway to Success Program is a k-12 and post secondary educational partnership designed to provide students and their families with a local educational pathway through College to Career.
